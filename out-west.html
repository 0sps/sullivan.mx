  <h2><span class="kicker">CHAPTER 1</span> THE ROAD</h2>
  <p class="dropcap">The Tennessee highway stretched ahead of me like a question mark made of asphalt. I pressed my foot harder against the gas pedal of my Kia, watching the speedometer climb past eighty. My new self driving computer sat atop the windshield, named Comma, was quietly doing its job of steering along the endless white and yellow lines ahead me.</p>
<p>I start recording a voice memo so I don’t forget the way life feels right now—nervous, buzzing, a little reckless. In case the future me needs proof I actually did this.</p>
<p>I’m still coming off a high from last night, and this being the first official day of the road trip. Just me, the car, and the unknown, for the next 4 weeks.</p>
<p>But last night was more than just the beginning of a drive. It was the beginning of a series of tally marks I pretend not to keep track of: things I chose before Will.</p>
<p>Last night, I chose Clay.</p>
<p>My plan was to potentially see Will, my boyfriend, at his apartment in Cincinnati last night. We discussed a plan last minute; I thought it would be nice to spend one last night together before spending the next month apart. However, this very specific person from my past had resurfaced, and the thought of seeing him had been on my mind all week.</p>
<p>As I drove, I thought. Then I acted.</p>
<p>My phone appeared in my hand. A text message opened.</p>
<p>Change of plans. You free tonight?</p>
<p>Always free for you, Clay responded instantly.</p>
<p>Fifty-five minutes added to the route. A turn I didn’t announce. Clay opened the door in a smile and a gray T-shirt, the kind that makes you aware of his shoulders. His apartment smelled fresh, like laundry detergent. We caught up during pillowtalk and I forced him to listen to my life problems for a few minutes before our night officially began. This night would be worth every minute it added to my trip.</p>
<p>"Will ended up getting insanely drunk last night," I spoke into my phone as the voice memo continued, exhaling pure relief at the vindication.</p>
<p>"He woke up hungover this morning. So not only would I have barely slept, and barely seen him, but he was wasted anyway. Clay was waiting for me, completely sober. We had a great time."</p>
<p>I could mark it up as logistics—Clay was awake, sober, twenty minutes closer, and Will would be out the door at 7:30am anyway—but that’s not the whole truth. I know it, my body knows it, and this car knows it. That choice was made intentionally.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Clay is easy to explain and hard to ignore. 6 feet tall, ex-football player, extremely handsome features, and some kind of innate feeling about me that makes him crave ‘us’ just much as I do. It threw me for a loop when we first met. I questioned how someone could simultaneously be both that attractive and also be into me. With Clay, there’s a kind of controlled roughness to it: we see each other and instantly know what to do. With Clay, my senses open up and my brain shuts off. In the moment, it’s incredible. Afterward we lay there and he tells me three facts about medicine and one about tractors, and I stare at the ceiling thinking this could be perfect if I didn’t want a future. He’s not that guy. He told me himself. And still, I picked him.</p>
<p>Will is different: structure in human form. A calendar invite who can deadlift. He works hard enough that I want to work harder. He’s the guy who looks at my apartment and says, “we should get you new towels,” and means well, but all I hear is another thing about me that needs improving. He makes me want to be better, and I hate how much I compare myself to him. He’s safety and static all at once. But whatever he is, he’s not my priority. I made will wait 3 months in an attempt to close the door on whatever clay and I were. After last night, it appears this was a revolving door.</p>
<p>The truth about Will is more complicated than my frustration suggests. I do like him—genuinely. There's something about the way he carries himself, compact and confident in a body that's built like he's been preparing for something his whole life. He's shorter than anyone I've dated, maybe 5'7 on a good day, but he moves through the world like he's forgotten to be self-conscious about it. His shoulders fill out shirts in a way that makes me want to work harder at the gym, and by summer his skin takes on this golden tone that honestly makes me wonder if he’s too attractive for me.</p>
<p>It’s not that will isn’t attractive or sweet. The problem is that our relationship never made sense to me. For starters, he told me he loved me one week after we started dating. One week. This is the same way he apparently fell for his ex, after seven days, and decided she was the one. It's like he's trying to speedrun relationships, checking boxes on some invisible timeline that has nothing to do with actually knowing me. "I love you" becomes less about love and more about him convincing himself he's found his perfect match before he has to do the messy work of figuring out who I actually am.</p>
<p>And the second, more serious problem, is that the first time we had sex wasn’t consensual. Me being dumb in the moment, I tried to constantly ask if we could do something else, but I ultimately let him have his way. He was laser focused on one thing only, and it took me berating him over text the following afternoon for him to acknowledge and apologize for how pushy he was.</p>
<p>I’m not going to use the legal word to describe it. Rather, I’m going to move on. But let it be known that it happened once, and I told him we needed to wait several months to ever do that again. He agreed, and it ended up being fine.</p>
<p>Regardless of how pushy he could have been, and whether his “I love you” utterances were real or performant, I certainly believed he was into me. Before this road trip, I wanted as much of him in my life as I could get.</p>
<p>To that end, five weeks ago, alone in his apartment one night, I hatched what felt like the sweetest romantic gesture. Five letters. The fifth one was written first, being slipped under his bed that night as a hidden treasure to be discovered months later. The other four would be written on this road trip, each one containing a piece of a puzzle that slowly reveals itself. When decoded, they would spell out two messages: “I NEVER WANTED FOREVER UNTIL YOU”, a sweet phrase, and "RED RIVER GORGE AUGUST 15"—our next adventure. Hopefully.</p>
<p>It felt meaningful back then, sitting on his bedroom floor with a pen in my hand, imagining his face when he figured it out. But maybe I was just trying to fabricate the kind of romantic gesture that would fit his timeline, prove I was as invested in this perfect relationship as he needed me to be.</p>
<p>Sometimes with Will, I feel I am performing. Always wondering if this version of me is good enough for the character I was written in to. These letters.. quite the narrative I’m painting. “Will, I like you so much that I spent 3 months meticulously planning a message and sending it to you piece by piece. And I put so much effort into it that the final piece is hidden under your bed.” But do I want to be that romantic to him?</p>
<p>I feel like I’m doing a nice gesture, but after seeing Clay last night I wonder why do it at all. Is this narrative even true?</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why I’m here—southbound, starting something I only half planned. Tonight is Steph’s house in Atlanta, a pregame for the rest of this trip. Tomorrow I cross state lines again and head into the JPMorganChase Plano office like I belong there. The first half of the trip is tidy and booked. The second half is a blank slate that demands to be planned out. Maybe not today, but soon.</p>
<p>I’m not running away. I tell myself that twice. I’m moving toward something, which is the more professional way to run.</p>
<p>Atlanta gets closer. Steph will throw open her door and pull me into her orbit and for a night I’ll be just a friend in a room full of new names and wigs and people who don’t need anything from me except a good story. Tomorrow I become the version of me with a building and a badge again. After that, the map dissolves into heat haze and my handwriting: Tempe maybe. Utah if my knee behaves.</p>
<p>Last night I chose Clay. Today I chose the car. With Will, I keep choosing and un choosing in my head, toggling between the man who makes me want to schedule my life and the man who lets me forget I have one. The truth is that neither of them helps me answer the burning question: whether I’m writing a life or performing one.</p>
<p>Somewhere between exits, between letters I haven’t mailed and a conversation I owe Will about the difference between loving fast and loving real, I’m going to have to pick a life. For now I pick south. I pick Steph. I pick the version of me who keeps going. Much like the letters I plan on sending to Will, and like my calendar for the second half of this trip, there remains a lot to be written. A story I have yet to figure out.</p>
<p>That’s why I left it blank.</p>

  <h2><span class="kicker">CHAPTER 2</span> ATLANTA, GA</h2>
  <p>I hit the city at 5:12 p.m., a little frayed from traffic and a thunderstorm and whatever Tennessee had left on my windshield. Steph’s house appeared in that way a friend’s place always does— familiar even when it isn’t. I was still moving stray protein tubs and a confusingly large pile of clothes out of the backseat when she appeared.</p>
<p>“Need any help?” Shouted a girl’s voice from across the front yard.</p>
<p>I turned my head and saw her. Despite it being 9 whole months since we last saw eachother, Steph looked exactly the same. I yelled her name, dropped my stuff in my car,  and offered the biggest hug I could give. She took me inside, and the place was cold—blessedly, unapologetically cold—and I felt my shoulders drop. The upstairs would be all to myself, which felt like a small favor given all the driving I had just done. I could make a mess out of sight. no one needed to witness how much of my life I’d packed into a Kia.</p>
<p>Two roommates appeared—Lauren and, embarrassingly, Not-Lauren-Because-I-Never-Heard-Her-Name. After some hellos, Steph caught me up in the kitchen: no guy at the moment, drama with a PwC coworker who weaponized honesty into something mean. He’d claimed he talks shit “to people’s faces, not behind their backs,” the way a person might brag about a flaw if they could make it sound respectable. Steph shrugged and imitated his voice. “I’m not like other girls,” she blurted at exactly the wrong moment in his text chain, and I burst out laughing. the ridiculousness read louder than any moral.</p>
<p>Upstairs, I skipped showering and layered deodorant like armor. Congestion had plagued my nose for days, so I couldn’t smell myself, which was suddenly a risk. I pulled on my Goodwill red flannel cutoff from years ago and donned a mullet wig. I decided this joke would have to carry me if my cologne couldn’t.</p>
<p>Very quickly, the house filled with new names and light beer: Deanna, who made a note about where string lights should go before she made one about me; Ford from Toledo; a trio who worked at Accenture; and then the phantom “Markia,” who I assumed was a company until a woman turned and said, “no, I’m Markia,” and connected a week's worth of dots in five seconds. a small, stupid epiphany I loved her for. Steph’s older cousins showed up—Corinne with the bright personality you immediately want at your table, a fiancé who cross-examined me on my JPMorgan job until it became a bit.</p>
<p>I hadn’t had a night like that in a while—a room where the only expectation was that I show up and be a person. with Will’s family, last weekend, I’d felt like I’d been trying to earn an invisible grade. here, the only test was whether I could carry a conversation and keep pace while walking in a wig. it turns out I can.</p>
<p>We left before midnight because I had orchestrated a sober, early exit into a twelve-hour drive. this had been the plan: sleep eight hours, leave in the morning, drive to Texas, make a respectable appearance at the office on Monday. I walked Steph home past the underflow of a city at last call. in the middle of the street, everyone took off their wigs and looked instantly softer, funnier, human. I kept mine on for a few extra beats and told them I’d spent three years growing it out for this party. someone swung fake hair over their shoulder and the group howled. by the time we reached the house we’d shed the bits and were just people again. Wigs started flying, onto each other’s heads or straight up into the sky. It was the most fun I’d had in a long time.</p>
<p>Back at the house, Steph handed me a box of cookies from Corinne, and I ate one like a child caught sticking his hand in the jar. That, plus the ramen noodles I’d microwaved earlier in the middle of the party, were the only ways I veered off-plan. It’s ridiculous how proud of that I felt. I said goodnight to a kitchen of women and Meemaw and a few stragglers, and took the stairs two at a time, beaming at the thought that a room had been kept cold for me.</p>
<p>Sleep came in efficient slices and woke me up with the urgency of a flight. Cold air bit at my face. Sometime after two I pulled on long sleeves from the red bag and made a second attempt at resting. At six-fifty-eight, my alarm hit at the lip of a sleep cycle, and I stood up grateful to not be a zombie. it’s funny what data your body will give you if you ask nicely; my brain, a clock with a 90-minute hand.</p>
<p>downstairs, quiet—just the hum of a refrigerator and the early stirrings of a house getting ready to be a house again. I wrote Steph a note thanking her for the upstairs and the orbit and the kind of night that asks nothing of you beyond your presence. I slipped it under her door because in a different story that kind of gesture would come off as too much, and in this one it was just right.</p>
<p>I left the city and missed it before the skyline was in my rearview. Atlanta looked like possibility dressed up as traffic. I thought about the way Spencer had said, “kickball,” when I asked him how he made friends, how Steph had said, “run club,” and how both of them had stopped going once they had the people they needed. there’s a simplicity to that I envy. Pick a thing. Do it until you don’t need the thing anymore. it made the idea of moving feel less like cliff-jumping and more like crossing a street.</p>
<p>The drive to Addison was long and disciplined. I stopped in Birmingham for a pull day because my body asked for it; the leg press didn’t hurt my knees for the first time in weeks, which felt like a bigger sign than it was. Will and I snapped each other from two separate states. he told me I was hot, and for once, after a night of strangers and a full mirror and a cheap flannel working harder than it should, I believed him without qualifications. You’re damn right, I thought.</p>
<p>Atlanta was a reminder that I can still show up somewhere new and leave with faces I want to see again. last night I chose friends and a wig and walking home before midnight. this morning I chose the car. somewhere between those choices is a life I’m trying to refine—one where I don’t have to manufacture the right gestures to prove I’m in it.</p>
<p>I merged onto the interstate south, Comma humming as it traced the stripes. somewhere out there was Dallas, then desert, then mountains that turn the horizon into a dare. the map ahead was tidy for now, then blank. Atlanta, with its crowded bar and cold house and wig hair on the kitchen floor, had reminded me I could enjoy the unplanned without feeling like I was losing control. I could reconnect with an old friend and feel the same love and warmth in a connection not rekindled in several months.</p>
<p>The road asked me for the same open-mindedness. So I leaned into it.</p>
</section><section id="chapter-3" class="section">
  <h2><span class="kicker">CHAPTER 3</span> DALLAS, TX</h2>
  <p>7 hours after my head hit the cold pillow in Steph’s attic, the morning sun cracked open clean and I was already moving. I left Atlanta early enough that the road felt empty, Comma tracing the white lines like a metronome while I sat inside the small quiet of post-party thoughts. The map said 11 hours; my body wasn’t fazed. Somewhere outside Birmingham, I pulled off to an old gym I had visited years ago, and reminded myself what a good rep feels like. The leg press didn’t hurt my knees for the first time in weeks. And a new PR. I loved it.</p>
<p>After that, the drive became a blur, and the car became everything: a kitchen, a locker room, a planning room, a confession booth. I kept thinking of how easy it had been to just be just a person last night. It made everything else feel new. I felt refreshed.</p>
<p>Dallas was the next line on the itinerary, tidy and booked. The rest of the trip after that went fuzzy. I liked that. You can only schedule so much before your life starts to feel like back-to-back meetings.</p>
<p>The sun lowered ahead of me in flat, long planes and the highway widened like it always does when a city is about to announce itself. Dallas wasn’t just about exploring a new city, though. It brought to my mind faint memories of an old person more than a new place.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Edgar had lived in the margins of my life for years. We met online two summers ago, coincidentally during my first road trip. He was the patient kind of handsome—dark eyes, careful smile, the sense that he’d already weighed the costs of telling you what he actually wanted. We texted through long stretches of seasons—periodic check-ins that always felt a step from detouring into something real. When I thought about moving, I thought about him. Dallas became less a place and more a door he might open.</p>
<p>I arrived after 9PM, the day wound down to its final closing. I walked into a Kroger, bought nothing of importance, and took a call from Michael while a microdose shroom decided to show up right as the automatic doors slid open. I checked in to my new home for the week, a Hyatt. The woman at the desk—Chris—looked at me with deadpan clarity and said,</p>
<p>“everyone gets two free bottles of water upon check in… We are out.”</p>
<p>It was perfect. I laughed so hard that she laughed too, and that small, ridiculous exchange was all the welcome I needed.</p>
<p>The next morning, the campus rose out of the north Texas plain like an office park had learned how to be a city. Glass. Steel. An algorithm of parking lots. I found a desk I was allowed to pretend was mine and watched people I didn’t know move with purpose I recognized anyway.</p>
<p>At lunch, in a quiet corner with institutional lighting and the hum of a vending machine that probably predated my career, I typed out a message I had sent in one form or another for years: Finally in town. Want to do something?</p>
<p>Edgar was the possibility I had traded on when I talked about moving. He was also the warning. Last time we had texted, he told me he was activated in the Guard - and posted in Oklahoma City for a stretch. I offered to visit him on Friday. He said it depended on the time; he’d be “in the field” until Sunday. He said service was bad. I stared at the text and decided not to push. Then Tinder told me Edgar was thirteen miles away.</p>
<p>Dallas was very easily traversable, but I know that 13 miles away was not Oklahoma city. Conveniently, 13 miles away from my very location was Uptown, where Edgar had told me he lived, back when we texted regularly.</p>
<p>I wondered whether that was just the last time he was in town. Tinder heard my thoughts. “Recently active” glowed under his profile, a small neon sign that illuminated his lies bright as day.</p>
<p>The office week did what office weeks do—reduced time into useful blocks. I found a coffee with my mentor, Minnie, who looked like the kind of person who actually enjoyed building bridges and then walking people across them. Between meetings, I dropped the first of the letters to Will into the mail—another narrative I’d built to make us make sense. The puzzle I’d imagined back on his bedroom floor felt ornate and earnest. After Clay, after Atlanta, it also felt like I was installing furniture in a house I might be moving out of.</p>
<p>Tuesday night, I drove south through the center of the city, that long sequence of frontage roads and fast-food signs and car lots blinking in the heat like they were trying to outshine one another. I treated myself like a local—gym, basketball, shower—then met up with an old friend.</p>
<p>We caught up in Uptown. If I wasn’t meeting Edgar there, I was still checking it out, lest I be swayed to move here in the future.</p>
<p>He was a little late, so I let my phone fill the silence. How interesting, Edgar posted a story. “The happiest of hours,” read his Instagram page, alongside two wine glasses and a bar I could triangulate without even trying.</p>
<p>It could have been an old clip. It could have been that the ‘field’ had a bar. But it was not the kind of coincidence I enjoy being on the wrong side of.</p>
<p>There’s a particular kind of disappointment reserved for people you’ve built futures on in your head. It isn’t dramatic; it’s quiet. It just removes color. I realized in that moment, Edgar had always been a door kept mostly closed. I’d just been content to imagine what the room inside looked like. He had said the right things at the right registers when I was ready to hear them. “We’ll make it work,” on a night where hope had texted first. What used to read like flattery now read more clearly; lies.</p>
<p>I still had to text him back.</p>
<p>“Good luck at the rest of your air force assignment,” I’d written back to his last message, giving him an out for a story I no longer believed.</p>
<p>“It seems like you’re not that into me. Hopefully you can see that I tried.”</p>
<p>It felt too generous and exactly like me.</p>
<p>Dallas sprawled and buzzed and let me pass unnoticed. I took my streak of sobriety into the week without making it a personality. I showed up at a JPMC happy hour directly after work because uncomfortable social situations are easier to force yourself into when you’re already dressed. Despite being anxious, I met new interns, listened to women from CIB tell me their clients treat them like secret weapons, and watched the sun sink into a bright haze behind a square of glass.</p>
<p>That was one of the good highlights of the week. But the week was a highlight reel that kept going back to Edgqar. When I tried to explain to myself what Edgar was, the words came out simple: he was my “What if.” If I move, do I get the immediate intimacy I’ve been pretending geography prevented me? If I stay back in Ohio, do I lock myself in a too-small room and call it safety? The truth was less romantic: People are not cities, and cities are not cures. Choosing one and hoping to get the other is the surest way to be disappointed.</p>
<p>Wednesday was a new day. Work was uneventful. On my way to shoot hoops after work, I called Will and listened to the list items of accomplishments he cataloged that afternoon. He is efficient at being himself. He tells me about his apartment like he’s pitching a buy: expenses, pests, deals, timelines. I offer advice about leases like I’m good at committing to things. We say the right words and sometimes they feel like the right ones. I walked under Desert-colored light in north Dallas and wondered what shape the letters I’d mailed would make when they finally arrived in his hands. There’s a version where that’s enough—ricochet romance, puzzle pieces, the narrative you gift someone—but only when you can’t yet trust your instincts.</p>
<p>It took until the weekend for the Edgar thing to land without a thud. After enough driving, enough fluorescent-lit stores, enough messages that told their own story, I stopped making excuses on his behalf.</p>
<p>“Maybe he’s busy,” is a nice way to talk to yourself when your pride is wounded. “He’s into somebody else,” is a cleaner way of admitting you deserve someone who opens the door and doesn’t hide behind a training exercise. Especially someone who feigns drunk thoughts as true vulnerability and connection.</p>
<p>On the way back to the hotel that night, I rerouted past a post office and dropped another envelope into the slot. To Will. I liked the feel of a stamped plan in my hand even as the plan itself felt less certain. I was testing what mattered. I was letting the map get blanker on purpose.</p>
<p>Dallas had been a city with a person-shaped outline. By Friday, it was a landscape with an office, a skyline, and a stranger who’d taught me something by not showing up. the campus still hummed. Minnie still had a list of doors I could try. The basketball rims at that park still sounded off like a bell when a shot hit clean. I chose small, repeatable things and let that be the definition of momentum.</p>
<p>On my last night before heading west, I drove around the city, with only my thoughts to keep me company. I thought about how many versions of myself I’d been in the last five days: the employee, the runner-on, the one who plans a scavenger hunt of letters because puzzles can stand in for feelings; the one who believes he’s worth someone choosing him and then watches what they actually choose.</p>
<p>Edgar wasn’t an introduction to a love story; he was a mirror. Dallas wasn’t a door another person was about to open; it was an empty hallway I was already walking down.</p>
<p>There was still Arizona ahead. desert and heat and an old friend who speaks in big gestures and a couch I’d fall asleep on. There were mountains that turn the horizon into a dare. Out there lies a version of me who doesn’t mistake almosts for promises. I turned onto the freeway, let the lane markers pull me forward, and didn’t check my phone.</p>

  <h2><span class="kicker">CHAPTER 5</span> Amarillo, TX</h2>
  <p>Four hours west of Dallas, the Texas panhandle flattened into vast open fields, and suddenly there I was, pulling into Amarillo for the third time in my life. It wasn't a destination.. not really—just a staple on these road trips, a waypoint between the structured east and the unknown ahead. The town sprawled low and unassuming, all faded billboards and small shopping centers humming with the kind of persistence that small places have, as if they know they're not the main event but they'll stick around anyway. I'd hyped it up in my head, maybe because it marked progress, or maybe because stopping here felt like a tradition at this point. The younger, less certain me who last visited here was always chasing something just over the horizon.</p>
<p>This time, though, Amarillo carried weight. The first half of my road trip calendar was fully fleshed out—offices, friends, planned detours—but as I cross off yet another week, the blank pages began to loom. A deliberate void I'd left to force myself into the question I'd been dodging: what did I truly desire, deep down, from this life I was piecing together? Will was back in Ohio, his world a grid of certainties and schedules, while I was out here embracing the chaos of the open road, searching for something that felt like my own.</p>
<p>I made straight for Cadillac Ranch, the bizarre roadside attraction where old cars stick halfway out of the ground. Appearing like ancient cars that lost a fight with a twister, passerby would stop and spray-paint them with dreams bigger than their hometowns. It wasn't art in the gallery sense—more like communal vandalism, a place where travelers left their marks before the wind and rain erased them. Ladybug Ranch was its quirkier sister nearby, but Cadillac called to me, because it felt like tradition, and regularity felt in short supply. After a long drive, legs stiff from the pedal, it was a relief to park, stretch, and wander out into the field. The air was dry and hot, carrying the faint metallic tang of rust and fresh paint. A few other cars dotted the pull-off, families snapping photos, a couple laughing.</p>
<p>I'd never tagged them before, always just observed, but today’s visit demanded participation. I had dreamed of a scene in my head for weeks, and a Cadillac ranch marked with spray paint was my way to materialize it. There was a popup shop nearby hawking overpriced cans, but fate—or lazy tourists—had built a little mound of discards at the entrance, half-empty tins glinting in the sun. I rummaged through, fingers becoming sticky, and found one with some black paint left, heavy enough to promise a few good sprays. The cars loomed ahead, their bodies a riot of colors and scrawls: names, dates, crude drawings overlapping like layers of forgotten stories. I approached one and stood there for a moment, can in hand.</p>
<p>The only thing missing was a hand to hold.</p>
<p>The wind kicked up, and the silence of being alone felt louder than the rattling ball inside the can. In that moment, I missed Will. Or, at least, the Will I was imagining in my head right now. I pictured him here with me, laughing at the absurdity of it all, maybe taking the can from me to add his own mark. It was a perfect scene, a snapshot from a future I was actively trying to build, one letter at a time. This was exactly the kind of spontaneous, romantic thing I wanted us to be.</p>
<p>I reached out, arm's length from the car’s frame, and pressed the nozzle. Black paint hissed out in unsteady arcs: SS + WF. My initials and his, a testament to the fantasy. I stepped back, admiring the work. It looked solid, permanent, even though I knew it would be painted over by a stranger tomorrow. This was a gesture for us, for the story I wanted to be true. I took a picture to send with the next letter, proof that I was thinking of him.</p>
<p>I stood there imagining his reaction. He would love it, I imagined—the spontaneity, the grand romantic gesture hidden in a dusty field. But a small, quiet thought nudged its way in: wouldn’t the real Will judge me somehow. Every time I’ve driven him somewhere, he’s judged me for something. That’s part of the reason why I had enjoyed starting this trip solo.</p>
<p>I pushed the thought down. It was easier to believe in the fantasy, in the guy who would see this as a piece of our story, not a logistical flaw in my itinerary. It was easier to believe I wasn’t just lonely and he was all I needed.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Will I missed, I realized, but the idea of having someone—anyone—who would see this moment through my eyes and think, yes, this is perfect. He was just the name I had assigned to that feeling.</p>
<p>I lingered a bit longer, walking among the cars, tracing other people's marks with my fingers. A heart here, a profanity there—echoes of shared moments. It made me feel the quiet emptiness even more acutely. The thought lingered as I headed back to the Kia, the engine humming to life like an old friend.</p>
<p>The day wasn't done yet. I stopped at a local bar on the edge of town, one of those dimly lit spots with neon signs flickering against wood-paneled walls. It was my first time walking into a place like that alone—no plan, no wingman, just the gnawing loneliness and an itch for connection. I pushed through the door, the air thick with cigarette smoke and the low murmur of conversations. A few locals glanced up from their beers, nodding as I slid onto a stool. "Do you have a menu?” I asked the bartender, making eye contact as she wiped down the counter with a rag that had seen better days.</p>
<p>I ordered a soda and a sandwich. We got talking— me and the locals at the bar. One guy, weathered face like the panhandle itself, spun yarns about his farming job here in Texas. He works 20 hour shifts for one weekend a year and makes twenty thousand dollars from it. A younger man with a laugh like gravel shared tips on how to take care of a Chevy, since the one on the TV in front of us looked disheveled.</p>
<p>No one asked for my story beyond the basics; they just shared theirs, and for an hour, the hole that had opened up at the ranch didn't feel so vast. I was just a guy on a trip, talking to people. It was simple.</p>
<p>I left Amarillo as the sun inched toward the horizon, just enough time to reach my next stop by nightfall. The drive felt different now. It felt more freeing. That spray-painted declaration wasn't a question, but it wasn't a clear answer either. It was an act of hope for a future that felt a little less real with every mile I put between me and Ohio.</p>
<p>That’s enough thinking for now. An eventful day behind me, and an eventful evening ahead. I was about to see an old friend for the first time in two years.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 4 
CORONA, NM</p>
<p>The name Corona had become a landmark in my personal geography. Not because of the beer I was six months away from drinking again, nor the virus that had rewritten the world, but a tiny town in New Mexico that existed for seemingly no reason at all. Years ago during my first road trip west, a well-optimized Google Maps page for a place called the Corona Motel appeared out of nowhere. The reviews were genuine, and it at drew me in that specific way that small-town gems do.</p>
<p>Two visits that summer, and the second one had ended with me, Rhonda the owner, and her friends getting drunk in the general store next door, followed by the worst hangover of my life—a special kind of agony, I'd later learn, that only 7,500 feet of elevation can provide. Now, two years later, the road was pulling me back on purpose.</p>
<p>I timed my arrival for just prior to nightfall, racing the sun across the plains of New Mexico. The landscape shifted from flat, predictable Texas into something otherworldly, a high-desert expanse that felt both uninhabitable and deeply inviting, like a video game rendered in meadows and dirt. The kind of place that looked like it shouldn't support life but somehow did, stubbornly. I was chasing the sunset tonight, angling to see it from the very same park bench I watched from years ago.  As the highway gave way to the familiar two-lane road, the windows came down, thin desert air rushing in. God, how light it felt out here. How the sky seemed twice as big.</p>
<p>A quick stop for water and granola bars at a general store that sold virtually nothing, then the final stretch. The motel appeared, a little more weathered than memory suggested, a little more sun-beaten, but there. Same hand-painted sign. Same gravel lot. The Kia's door opened, and the familiar scrape of plastic on asphalt announced itself. The splash guard, dragging again. Of course.</p>
<p>Backpack and duffel bag in hand, I walked 10 paces to the office. Two men stood talking by a central desk where a skinny, white-haired woman sat, head down, shuffling through papers. She looked up as the door opened, and the men fell silent. It was Rhonda.</p>
<p>My eyes caught her attention. "Hi, checking in," the words came out louder than intended in the small room.</p>
<p>Her eyes focused, narrowing slightly, then widening with recognition. "Oh hi, we spoke on the phone." A pause. "I remember you. You've been here before, right?"</p>
<p>A laugh of pure relief escaped me. “Yeah, I’m Sean. Stayed here twice two summers ago. I told myself even if it added time to my drive, I had to come back and see you. This place is just too cool.”</p>
<p>A genuine smile spread across her face. “Well I like to hear that. Glad you’re back.”</p>
<p>I was still feeling the trip in my veins, a low-level buzz that made me more nervous than I should be. The two men, James and Steve, introduced themselves with smiles. Steve had a high pitched voice that made me suspect something. He insisted I had to do karaoke later at the new Social Club. Rhonda handed me a pass.</p>
<p>“You can go,” she said, her eyes narrow, “but you have to promise to be good.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try my best,” I offered.</p>
<p>“Oh no, don’t try your best,” she shot back, deadpan. “You need to be good.”</p>
<p>We all laughed, and just like that, the tension of the drive—the shrooms still buzzing faintly in my system, the solitude of the road, the uncertainty of showing up somewhere after two years—melted away. This was Corona: a place where you were welcomed into the fold before you'd even put your bags down.</p>
<p>Rhonda gave me the key to the "jungle room," admitting it wasn't quite finished yet. She was right. It was bare-bones, but it was a room, and it was mine. I saw a cockroach and a fly in there. At a normal motel, I’d be upset, but Rhonda could do no wrong. It’s fine.</p>
<p>My bags hit the floor with a thud, but the light outside was already shifting—golden hour wouldn't wait. The Kia carried me back to the same park from which I’d seen the sunset two years ago. Back then, ambitious Sean went on a tiring run around the place. Today, I was tired. I tossed my drone onto the ground and spun it into life, capturing the sunset as it exploded in color. This quiet, windy section of New Mexico hadn't changed at all. In a road trip defined by new, this felt familiar.</p>
<p>The sunset didn’t last long, but I didn’t need it do. It occupied a checkmark on a mental bucket list of things I hoped to experience during this trip.</p>
<p>Back at the motel, Rhonda, Steve, and James sat in a loose circle of folding chairs out front, drinks in hand, their silhouettes backlit by the last glow of the day. The old fear of intrusion kicked in—outsider syndrome, the belief that every group is a closed door—but the moment passed. Feet carried me forward.</p>
<p>"You guys mind if I join?"</p>
<p>Smiles occupied the trio’s faces as they welcomed me in without a second thought. A chair was pulled up for me.</p>
<p>Steve turned out to be a retired architect from Dallas, splitting his time between Texas and Corona. James worked construction on the new wind farms sprouting up across the landscape, explaining the increase in turbines on my drive in, and turning Corona into an unlikely boomtown. He told me about the grueling hours, the weeks away from family, the trade-off of good money for a life lived on the road. I thought about my office job, the predictability I was running from, and felt a pang of gratitude for it. I could go home every night. These guys couldn't.</p>
<p>The conversation flowed as easily as the beer they were drinking. Rhonda mentioned her infamous sangria and asked if I wanted a glass.</p>
<p>“Oh, I remember your sangria,” I said with a mischievous smile.  “That’s what gave me that killer hangover.”</p>
<p>“Well, what I do is I take the sangria,” she explained innocently, “and I add some brandy, some triple sec, a little club soda…”</p>
<p>“Brandy? You put brandy in it? Rhonda, that’s what killed me!”</p>
<p>The circle erupted in laughter. She was insane, and I loved her for it. As the sky turned from purple to black, people started to drift off. Steve headed to the Social Club, telling me to meet him there.</p>
<p>I went with Rhonda to the general store to grab some snacks for my road trip tomorrow, but also to continue talking. The place was really a hub for the small town. She told me how she cooks pizzas for lines of construction workers that stretched down the street at lunchtime. She was 67, running the motel, the store, multiple properties, and a breakfast cart she started at 3 a.m., and she was trying to sell some of what she owned because it was all just too much. She was a force of nature.</p>
<p>After handing me the burger she insisted on making, and ringing up my bag of pretzels at the register, Rhonda sat down at one of her dining tables and gestured for me to join her.</p>
<p>"You really have it all here, Rhonda," I said as we kept talking. "But it's insane how much you work. When are you giving up the store?"</p>
<p>She didn't flinch. "Oh dear, hopefully soon. It's good business but I need someone else to do it. I'm tired."</p>
<p>I didn’t believe that. Somehow after a 12 hour workday, she manages to cook, clean, hang out with me and the other guests, and she mentioned going to the social club. I couldn’t believe her.</p>
<p>My mom was brought up. I tell Rhonda all the time about how I wish my mom were like her- a retired businesswoman who randomly decides running a motel is her new calling. Rhonda kept busy, and it gave her purpose. My mom was the opposite; too much free time, too little purpose.</p>
<p>Funny enough, Rhonda moved to this city to be near her son when he relocated to Albuquerque, but a few years in and her son actually ended up here. Now her whole family called this little alcove of New Mexico home.</p>
<p>"Does he like it here?" I asked.</p>
<p>She shrugged. "He seems happy. You should ask him yourself—he's running the bar at the club tonight."</p>
<p>"Well, you'd better finish that before it gets cold," she said, pointing at the plate with the kind of authority only a grandmother or a motel owner can muster.</p>
<p>A smile. "Are you going to the social club tonight?"</p>
<p>"Sure, I'll go for a few minutes. Are you?"</p>
<p>Why not, I thought. "I'll be there."</p>
<p>She smiled. "Perfect. Let me lock this place up and I'll see you over there."</p>
<p>I went back to my room with the snacks. A few bites in, I felt the hum of the social club call to me. Two years ago, it had been just a project she was starting, a sidenote at the end of a long conversation full of life updates. Now, it was the heart of the town.</p>
<p>The walk over was short, but my nerves kicked in standing outside the door. The building was beautiful—a rustic, Victorian-style oak structure with string lights draped across the outdoor patio and the low thrum of music spilling out into the night. A social club in a town of less than a hundred people felt like something out of a fictional TV show. With nothing else like it in Corona, it truly was the place to be.</p>
<p>First instinct: turn back. Then a thought hit, a mantra from some self-help guru years ago: Massive action. It had worked at the bar in Amarillo. It could work again. The alternative was clear—a boring night spent between my journal pages, surrounded only by thoughts. But if I walk through that door? Endless possibilities. There's a difference between the Sean of two years ago and the Sean standing here today. But that only stays true if the door opens right now.</p>
<p>Push. Walk in.</p>
<p>The place was packed—or at least, packed for Corona. For some reason it still didn’t feel normal to walk into a bar alone. This is what adults do, right?</p>
<p>I made out maybe fifteen people, mostly men, their laughter and conversation bouncing off the wooden walls. The bar was lit up, bottles gleaming behind it, and there was a small stage set up for karaoke. Steve appeared near the bar, waving me over.</p>
<p>He made introductions—Rhonda's husband, George, a quiet, solid presence who nodded and shook hands—and then Dylan, Rhonda's son, manning the bar. Dylan was younger than I expected, maybe early thirties, with an easy confidence and a quick smile. I ordered a soda and got pulled into the orbit of the room, talking to Dylan and the other bartender, Nathan, like I'd known them for years.</p>
<p>“So your mom said you moved back from the city for this?” I asked Dylan over the music.</p>
<p>He nodded, polishing a glass. “Yeah man. Lived in Albuquerque for years. I liked it. But you realize after a while… it’s just another city. It’s not the same if you don’t have your people. Family’s everything.” He shrugged as he set the glass down. “This is what I really wanted.”</p>
<p>His words hit me hard. I'd been hoping this whole road trip would help me fall in love with a big city so that moving out of Columbus made sense. I'd assumed a bigger city held the answer. But Dylan had run back to this tiny town and found his right where he never would have expected it. He'd chosen family over ambition, roots over novelty, and seemed genuinely happy about it. Maybe my blank calendar ahead didn’t need to be filled with cities and opportunities. Maybe it was supposed to be filled with people who actually mattered.</p>
<p>The thought didn't have time to settle. A woman named Stacy stumbled over, drunk with a strange accent no one could quite place, telling me with absolute certainty that I looked like her brother-in-law. Before I could fully process that, a man named Bo bought Rhonda a shot from across the bar, pulling her away from the seat next to mine. A few minutes later, he occupied that seat, Rhonda long gone.</p>
<p>Bo had a long red beard, a snapback hat, and kind eyes that didn’t match the roughness of his hands. He looked dressed for a night out, with a flannel that showed every muscle on his arms. The gay in me thought he was pretty attractive. But tonight I was making friends, nothing else.</p>
<p>We started talking, and the music, the laughter, the rest of the room faded away. I had to lean in, covering one ear to hear him over a karaoke rendition of a country song. He told me his story. Not in pieces, but in a torrent, as if he’d been waiting for someone to listen. He told me about his meth addiction back in Oklahoma. About injecting it in a hospital after his kid was born. About walking 13 miles home, high, just to get away from a fight. About jail, his dad selling his five cars to bail him out. The two kids, one of whom might be his, that he couldn’t see because going home inevitably meant going back to his drug dealer.</p>
<p>He wasn’t asking for pity. He was just telling me his life. He’d been in Corona for two years, working on the wind farm, taking the namesake of clean energy by staying clean from everything but weed and alcohol. He’d been promoted to foreman. He was building a new life, but he was haunted. He was leaving in two months, he said, maybe for Dallas, maybe Arizona. It wasn’t his choice. I sat there, a tourist on a journey of self-discovery, and listened to a story of actual survival. I had empathy for him that was so deep it ached. Raw, real, and completely unexpected, I asked as many questions as I could. But with me needing to leave promptly in 8 hours, and already running on low sleep, my time in this social club was numbered from the start.</p>
<p>Eventually he finished his story, and there was nothing to say but thank you. After asking questions along the way, and learning about just how much he had turned his life around, I shook his hand, told him it was great to meet him, and said goodnight to everyone. It was 10:30. I walked out of the club and looked up.</p>
<p>The sky was on fire. With no city lights to challenge it, the universe had laid itself bare. I could see the faint, cloudy smear of the Milky Way. I walked back to the park from earlier, my soda can still in hand, and just stared. The stars weren't in the background; they were the foreground, a brilliant, overwhelming presence. It was the same feeling I’d had two years ago in Arizona, a feeling of being infinitesimally small and yet part of something immeasurably vast. After hearing Bo’s story, the cosmic perspective felt like a necessary exhale.</p>
<p>The next morning, as I was putting belongings in my car, James called out to me in between cigarette puffs. How early did this man wake up? “Hear the commotion last night?” he asked. Turns out our friend Bo had been up until 4 a.m. with not one, but two women, in the room right next door. I’d slept through the whole thing with earplugs in. One of them was the same woman who said I looked like her brother last night. They were both drunk. Good for them, I thought.</p>
<p>Rhonda came out and confirmed it. “That’ll be the last time he stays here,” she said with a sigh, but there was no malice in it. Just the weary resolve of someone who has seen it all.</p>
<p>I gave her a hug goodbye, a real one this time. She pointed at my splash guard. “You gonna get that fixed?” I laughed and said I’d just have to drive on it. As I pulled out of the Corona Motel, leaving the found family, the stories, and the ghosts behind, I knew this stop had changed something. Dallas had been about a fantasy of a person. Amarillo, a fantasy of a relationship. Corona was real. It wasn’t a place I was moving to, but it showed me what a home could feel like: a group of people who see you, listen to you, and make you promise to be good, even when they know you probably won’t be. I somehow felt closer to these older people than my circle back home. Maybe it was how open they were about their lives. Or maybe it was the fact that I haven't stayed long enough to find something to dislike about them. But I felt a new sense of confidence on this road trip, and realized that I could meet friends anywhere I go. That was the aspiration for this trip, and now I realized it would be the norm.</p>
