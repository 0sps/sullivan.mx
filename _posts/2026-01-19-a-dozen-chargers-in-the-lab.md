## A Dozen chargers in the lab: apple is okay, but not the best

Hello! 
I have been inspired by Ken Shirriff to make a writeup of different USB Chargers you might find.

<p style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1-apple-retail.png" alt="Image 1" style="width: 48%;">
  <img src="/assets/images/2-apple-retail.png" alt="Image 2" style="width: 48%;">
</p>

I tested a dozen chargers and i have some interesting opinions on them.

- Technology and programming
- Mathematics and algorithms
- Interesting problems and solutions
- Personal projects and experiments

## Code Examples

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet("World")
```

## Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`. Lists work great too:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Conclusion

This blog is built with Jekyll and deployed on Netlify. It uses a minimalist design inspired by clean, readable blogs that focus on content over flashy design.

Stay tuned for more posts!
