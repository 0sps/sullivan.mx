## Introduction

Welcome to my new blog! This is an example post to demonstrate the blog structure and styling.

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be writing about:

- Technology and programming
- Mathematics and algorithms
- Interesting problems and solutions
- Personal projects and experiments

## Code Examples

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet("World")
```

## Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`. Lists work great too:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Conclusion

This blog is built with Jekyll and deployed on Netlify. It uses a minimalist design inspired by clean, readable blogs that focus on content over flashy design.

Stay tuned for more posts!
